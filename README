# NOTE
This project is about creating a VPC

Before running terraform init:
export TF_VAR_appstackcode="xxx"
export TF_VAR_aws_env="xxx" 
export TF_VAR_shortEnv="xxx" 
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="xxx"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="xxx"
In GitHub be sure that you added under secrets (settings/security/secrets&variables/actions/secret) AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY !!!
